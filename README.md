## Introduction

This is a basic React application bootstrapped with Vite, a next-generation frontend tooling.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Vite requires Node.js version >=12.0.0.
- npm (comes with Node.js installation) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (optional but recommended).

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-vite-app.git
```
2. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
cd react-vite-app
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```
### Development
To start the development server, run:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000 by default. You can now view your React application in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
